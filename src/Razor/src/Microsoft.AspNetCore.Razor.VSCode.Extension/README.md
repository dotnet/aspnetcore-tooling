# Info

In practice the Razor VSCode extension operates as a library that [OmniSharp](https://github.com/omnisharp/omnisharp-vscode) (O#) bootstraps and includes in its operation flow. Therefore, in order to provide a dev experience for testing out Razor VSCode extension changes this project attempts to replicate what O# does to bootstrap Razor's VSCode extension library.
