(1,2): Error RZ1035: Missing close angle for tag helper 'p'.
(1,2): Error RZ1034: Found a malformed 'p' tag helper. Tag helpers must have a start and end tag or be self closing.
(1,21): Error RZ1008: Expected a "{" but found a "<".  Block statements must be enclosed in "{" and "}".  You cannot use single-statement control-flow statements in CSHTML pages. For example, the following is not allowed:

@if(isLoggedIn)
    <p>Hello, @user</p>

Instead, wrap the contents of the block in "{}":

@if(isLoggedIn) {
    <p>Hello, @user</p>
}
